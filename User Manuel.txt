RULES:
--------------------
You are the “X”. Your opponent is the “O”.  On your turn, you place one piece on the board. 
You must place the piece so that an opponent's piece, or a row of opponent's pieces, is sandwiched by your pieces. 
All of the opponent's pieces between your pieces become your pieces.
Your goal is to have more pieces than your opponent by the end of the match, which happens when the player hits 0, 
or the board is filled.

HOW TO PLAY
-------------------------
The player goes first. Once the program begins, enter a row number, and hit enter. Then, enter a column number, 
followed by enter. This will make your move, and the AI will automatically make its move afterwards. 
Repeat until the game is terminated or completed.
